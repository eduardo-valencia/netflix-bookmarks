# Extension

## Commands

### `npx gulp dev`

**Note**: This requires <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-reloader/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid>.

Watches the application for changes. When it detects changes to the React App's code, it builds the extension automatically and reloads the extension.

### `npm popup-test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run popup-build`

Adds the extension into the extension's build folder so that we can load it into Chrome. Please note that the extension's build folder differs from the React App's build folder.
